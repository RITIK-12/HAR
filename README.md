### Introduction
* Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is of great value in a wide range of real-world applications, such as health, fall detection and smart home.
* There are generally two types of solutions for HAR: device-based and device-free.
* Device-based solutions rely mostly on wearable devices such as smartphones and smart watches. However, these solutions often cause discomfort and extra burden.
* To overcome the weaknesses, device-free solutions utilizing cameras and Radio-Frequency (RF) signals have later come into view.
* Unlike camera based solutions, RF-based approaches do not raise privacy concerns, and are not affected by temperature or lighting conditions.
* Therefore, RF-based solution has become a promising candidate for indoor HAR, leading to a large amount of research contributions recently

### Methodology

### Dataset Preparation
*Original dataset was acquired from [1].
* Three different sensors and a total of 11 diï¬€erent activities and ambulatory gaits were considered, as listed in the Figure 1.
* The images from the respective sensors were resized to 128x128.
* Then the data from the respective sensors was splitted into train,validation and test sets.
